## 👋 Hi there, I'm [Edward Li](https://www.edward-li.com/)!

I'm a **Computer Science and Physics** student at the 🏔**University of British Columbia**! I love building and working on projects that are interesting, unique, or anything in between! 

Previously, I worked at [Google/GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) working on OpenTelemetry builds across all GCP machines, at [Codegen](https://www.codegen.com/) building software agents and language servers, at [HP](https://www.hp.com/) on high-performant remote work software, and at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) creating distributed testing frameworks for fiber optic systems.
